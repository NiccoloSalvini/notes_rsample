## Gentle Introduction

-----

`rsample` contains a set of functions that can create different types of
resamples and corresponding classes for their analysis. The goal is to
have a modular set of methods that can be used across different R
packages for:

  - Traditional resampling techniques for estimating the sampling
    Distribution of a statistic and
  - Estimating model performance using a holdout set ( _tain test splitting_ )
  
In addition it can be used to in combination with `recipes` and `parnsip` to develop easy and reproducible model pipelines.
it supports train test splitting for a number of different data types: 
  - Survival analisys 
  - Time series Anlisys
  
It can also be used in:
  - Tuning models in nested resampling
  - Gridsearch and randomized search in `Keras`
  - Boostrap Interval Estimation
  

The scope of `rsample` is to provide the basic building blocks for
creating and analyzing resamples of a data set but does not include code
for modeling or calculating statistics. The “Working with Resample Sets”
vignette gives demonstrations of how rsample tools can be used.



## Terminology Alert... ([Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) called upon)

We define a resample as the result of a two-way split of a data set. For example, when bootstrapping, one part of the resample is a sample with replacement of the original data. The other part of the split contains the instances that were not contained in the bootstrap sample. Cross-validation is another type of resampling.

```{r libraries, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(rsample)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(skimr)

```


some quick reference to refresh [boostrapping technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgt7F6FqDU&t=8m48s) by the statquest. It automatically jumps to minute 8:48, don't worry. 


## Application

verybody know the mtcars dataset, if not, don't mind I will introduce you


```{r mtcars}

skimr::skim(mtcars)



```


```{r boostrapping}

# using mtcars
set.seed(123)
bt_resamples = bootstraps(mtcars, times = 3)
bt_resamples

```



## Individual Resamples are _rsplit_ Objects


The resamples are stored in the splits column in an object that has **class** :  _rsplit_.

In this package we use the following terminology for the two partitions that comprise a resample:

- The _analysis_ data are those that we selected in the resample. For a bootstrap, this is the sample with replacement. For 10-fold cross-validation, this is the 90% of the data. These data are often used to fit a model or calculate a statistic in traditional bootstrapping.(aka the *training* set even if authors do not reaaly want you to say that)

- The _assessment_ data are usually the section of the original data not covered by the analysis set. Again, in 10-fold CV, this is the 10% held out. These data are often used to evaluate the performance of a model that was fit to the analysis data. aka the *testing* set even if authors do not reaaly want you to say that)

ed. I am using a Tidyverse approach for the selection of elements in the `first_resample`, in particular the `pull()` selection to extract the column split, then the `pluck()` to pick the first element of the list of the list. (bt_resamples$splits[[1]])


```{r first_resample}

first_resample = 
  bt_resamples %>%
  pull(splits) %>% # pull selection 
  pluck(1)
  
first_resample

```

This indicates that there were **32** data points in the _analysis_ set, **14** instances were in the assessment set, and that the original data contained **32** data points. These results can also be determined using the dim function on an rsplit object.

## How to really call data 

```{r call data}

as.data.frame(first_resample) %>% 
  head()


```

### alternatively, way better than this


```{r call data alt}

analysis(first_resample) %>% dim()
assessment(first_resample) %>% dim()


```
